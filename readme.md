# JS-Fundamentals - Day 5: Assignment

First solo day of the bootcamp!!

We know how much desire you have to start with the assignment but first, let's have a TEST!!! I'm kidding, actually I'm not. But don't worry you will not have a grade.

In this [test](js-fundamentals.md) you will find 6 questions very related to the core concepts covered along the week. 

In order to solve them try to think as the JS Engine will do it. 

Use your words to answer the questions, it is not important how technical you are but rather how good do you understand the concepts.

Once you have finished call your instructor for a one to one review ✌️



## Bricks

As you know, this is not a graded assignment. It's just a project to measure your understandings of the topics so far.

It's something for you, to assess how comfortable you feel with the topics covered this week.

The assignment is nor a guided project nor it is pair programming. You will be on your own.

Feel free to ask for the assistance of the instructor. We encourage you to ask for a review of the instructor once you added a big feature.

In this week's assignment you will build the classic Arkanoid game, for those not familiarized with it check this [exampe](https://codepen.io/Eika/full/AtKkD/) online to see how it works.

This is a two day project and by the end of the today you should try to have all these features:
- A canvas.
- A ball bouncing arround that checks for collisions with the paddle.
- A paddle that moves based on the user's interaction.
- A wall of bricks.

For the second day we will finish it up by:
- Check collisions between the ball and the wall of bricks.
- A game workflow, where the user hits bricks until there are no more bricks or the ball hits the floor.
- A score area, where the number of lifes left and the points are displayed.
- [Deployment to Github pages][1] so you will first piece of code running on the web, so you can share it with friends and family.

### Bonus

- Increate the speed of the ball after every X seconds.
- The ball bounces different depending on where it bounces in the paddle. Check some online games to learn about this feature. Implement one you like.
- Implement different Brick Types. Some bricks should take 2 collisions to be removed. Some only one.
